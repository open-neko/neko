# CMMC 2.0 — Complete Requirements Disposition for OpenNeko

This document gives every CMMC 2.0 requirement an explicit disposition: all
110 NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 requirements for Level 2 (including the Level 1
requirements derived from FAR 52.204-21), plus all 24 NIST SP 800-172
requirements selected for Level 3. Product evidence is detailed where OpenNeko
contributes a mechanism. People, process, physical, and infrastructure
requirements are retained in the matrix as deployment responsibilities.

> **How to read this.** OpenNeko is a self-hosted software product, not a
> complete information system. CMMC certification applies to the *deploying
> organization's* system boundary; OpenNeko is one component inside it. The
> columns below record which side of that shared-responsibility line each
> control sits on, what OpenNeko itself ships, and the exact features/files
> that back the claim — so an assessor can verify rather than trust.

> **Assessed deployment profile.** This mapping evaluates OpenNeko's company
> deployment configuration, in which an SSO authentication plugin is mandatory
> and the IdP enforces unique user identities, MFA, password policy, account
> lockout, and applicable IdP session controls. OpenNeko's intentional
> unauthenticated solo mode is designed for a single operator on a locally
> controlled system and is outside this CMMC assessment boundary. The SSP and
> configuration baseline must record and enforce this restriction.

**Levels are cumulative:** Level 2 includes all Level 1 controls; Level 3
includes all Level 2 controls plus the 800-172 enhancements.

## Legend

| Column | Values |
|---|---|
| **L1 / L2 / L3** | The level label appears when the requirement applies at that cumulative CMMC level; blank means it is not introduced at that level. |
| **Applicability** | `Product` — OpenNeko must deliver it · `Deployment` — the hosting environment/org delivers it (OS, network, physical) · `Shared` — both contribute · `N/A` — not meaningful for this system |
| **Status** | `✅ Shipped` — OpenNeko's product responsibility is implemented and verifiable in the codebase · `🟡 Partial` — implemented with known limits (stated in rationale) · `❌ Gap` — applicable to the product but not implemented · `Inherited` — must be implemented and evidenced by the deploying organization; this document does not assert that a particular deployment satisfies it · `N/A` |

## Access Control (AC)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.1.1 | Limit system access to authorized users, processes, devices | L1 | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | In the assessed company profile, mandatory SSO provides per-user OIDC sign-in and sessions resolve to `app_user` rows (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`). Device admission and identification remain deployment controls. Intentional unauthenticated solo mode is outside this assessment boundary. |
| 3.1.2 | Limit users to permitted transactions/functions | L1 | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Role-gated admin routes (`apps/web/src/lib/admin-auth.ts` `requireAdminActor`); agent world-changing actions are proposal-gated by per-org action policies (`db/migrations/0011_action_stack.sql`, `0020_action_policy_created_by.sql`); plugin installs gated by install policy (`db/migrations/0019_install_policy_scope.sql`, `apps/web/src/lib/install-policy-settings.ts`). |
| 3.1.3 | Enforce CUI flow control | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Agent egress is default-deny, allowed per `(host, binary)` (`OPENSHELL.md`); plugin egress is limited to each manifest's allowlist (`PLUGINS.md`). Network-level flow control beyond the sandbox (VLANs, DLP) is the deployment's. |
| 3.1.5 | Least privilege | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | The agent is treated as untrusted: it runs sandboxed with no DB/secret access, reaching the control plane only through a narrow audited broker (`OPENSHELL.md`, `packages/llm/src/work/control-plane.ts`). Admin vs member roles gate administration. |
| 3.1.6 | Non-privileged accounts for non-security functions | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Mandatory SSO users receive distinct `admin` or non-privileged `member` roles (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` `defaultRoleForGroups`). Members can perform ordinary work and personal-layer operations without an administrative account, while organization settings and security administration are admin-gated (`packages/llm/src/work/authz.ts`, `apps/web/src/lib/admin-auth.ts`). The requirement does not mandate finer-grained RBAC. |
| 3.1.7 | Prevent non-privileged execution of privileged functions; log attempts | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Non-admin calls to admin routes return 403 (`apps/web/src/lib/admin-auth.ts`); privileged control-plane calls are recorded with dual identity — human + agent (`db/migrations/0042_dual_identity_audit.sql`, `control_plane_audit`). |
| 3.1.8 | Limit unsuccessful logon attempts | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | The assessed company profile delegates interactive authentication to the mandatory IdP; configure and evidence the IdP's lockout/throttling policy. Solo mode is outside scope. |
| 3.1.9 | Privacy/security logon banners | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko has no configurable banner on `/signin`; the deployment may provide the required notice at the IdP or access gateway. |
| 3.1.10 | Session lock with pattern-hiding display | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | OS-level screen lock on operator workstations; a web app cannot lock the workstation. |
| 3.1.11 | Automatic session termination | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Sessions terminate after a defined fixed 12 h TTL (`SESSION_TTL_SECONDS`, `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`); rotating `OPENNEKO_SESSION_SECRET` invalidates all sessions globally, and disabling a user invalidates their session on the next request (`getCurrentUser` checks `disabled_at`). An organization choosing a shorter or idle-based condition can enforce it at the mandatory IdP/access gateway. |
| 3.1.12 | Monitor and control remote access sessions | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | All web/API access is session-authenticated and privileged calls are audit-chained (see AU rows). VPN/gateway placement and monitoring of the path to the deployment is the operator's. |
| 3.1.13 | Cryptographic protection of remote access | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | The web app binds locally (`localhost:3000`); remote exposure requires the operator's TLS-terminating reverse proxy/VPN. Session cookies are marked `secure` in production (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` `writeSessionCookie`). |
| 3.1.14 | Route remote access via managed access points | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Deployment network architecture. |
| 3.1.15 | Authorize remote execution of privileged commands | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Every world-changing agent action becomes a proposal requiring human approval unless an explicit auto-fire rule exists (`FEATURES.md` "Approval gates"; `action_request` tables, `db/migrations/0011_action_stack.sql`). |
| 3.1.16 | Authorize wireless access before connection | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | No wireless surface in the product; authorization is enforced by deployment network controls. |
| 3.1.17 | Protect wireless access with authentication and encryption | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Deployment wireless identity and encryption controls. |
| 3.1.18 | Control connection of mobile devices | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | OpenNeko ships no mobile agent; mobile browser access is governed by deployment MDM and access controls. |
| 3.1.19 | Encrypt CUI on mobile devices and platforms | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Endpoint/MDM encryption control. |
| 3.1.20 | Verify/control connections to external systems | L1 | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Outbound connections are default-deny and enumerable: agent egress per `(host, binary)` via the OpenShell gateway, plugin egress per manifest allowlist (`OPENSHELL.md`, `PLUGINS.md`). The model API is the only egress the agent gets by default. |
| 3.1.21 | Limit portable storage on external systems | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Host/endpoint control. |

## Audit & Accountability (AU)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.3.1 | Create and retain audit logs | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Important run, proposal, decision, execution, and broker events are recorded, including a per-org hash chain (`db/migrations/0046_audit_chain.sql`, `packages/llm/src/workflows/audit-chain.ts`). Chain writes are best-effort, and OpenNeko does not enforce an organizational retention period; retention and durable export are deployment responsibilities. |
| 3.3.2 | Trace actions to individual users | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | In the assessed SSO profile, dual-identity audit records both the individual human and the agent acting for them (`db/migrations/0042_dual_identity_audit.sql`, `0031_actor_in_runs.sql`; `FEATURES.md` "no anonymous actions"). Solo mode is outside scope. |
| 3.3.4 | Alert on audit logging failure | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | A failed append emits a structured critical `security.audit_logging_failure` event to stderr, marks process-local audit health degraded for `GET /health/security`, and can deliver a non-blocking alert through an independently configured HTTPS webhook (`packages/llm/src/workflows/audit-chain.ts`, `apps/worker/src/admin-server.ts`, `INSTALL.md` "Audit logging failure alerts"). |
| 3.3.5 | Correlate audit records for investigation | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Audit trail is exportable for auditors and SIEM tools (`FEATURES.md` "Tamper-evident log"); natural-language audit queries ("what did the assistant do yesterday and who approved it?") give a readable timeline. |
| 3.3.6 | Audit reduction and report generation | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Plain-language audit timeline plus structured export (`FEATURES.md` "Audit in plain language"). |
| 3.3.7 | Clocks synced to authoritative time source | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Container/host NTP. Audit rows use DB timestamps (single Postgres = single clock). |
| 3.3.8 | Protect audit info from unauthorized access/modification | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | The hash chain detects edits or deletions that leave a later link, and appends serialize per org (`packages/llm/src/workflows/audit-chain.ts`). It cannot detect deletion of the tail or truncation of a suffix, and the database table itself is not immutable; database roles, durable export, and external anchoring are deployment controls. |
| 3.3.9 | Limit audit management to privileged users | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Product audit surfaces are admin-gated and no delete/edit API exists (`apps/web/src/lib/admin-auth.ts`). Direct database access and separation of audit administration from general database administration must be enforced by deployment roles. |

## Configuration Management (CM)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.4.1 | Baseline configurations and inventories | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | The stack is declared in versioned compose files (`compose.yml`, `compose.openshell.yml`), but some image references use floating tags such as `latest` rather than immutable digests. Installed plugins are inventoried in `openneko.plugins.json` with `installSource` + `installedAt` + `policySnapshot` (`PLUGINS.md`). Host OS baseline and the approved image/version baseline are the deployment's. |
| 3.4.2 | Enforce security configuration settings | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Secure-by-default posture: sandboxing is the only mode, not an option (`OPENSHELL.md` "SEC11 made it the default"); install policy defaults deny unverified/git-URL installs (`PLUGINS.md` `/settings/security`); current secret-store writers create files with mode `0600` (`packages/plugin-install/src/secrets-store.ts`, `packages/secret-crypt/src/index.ts`). |
| 3.4.5 | Access restrictions for configuration changes | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Settings and install policy changes require the admin role (`apps/web/src/lib/admin-auth.ts`); agent-proposed configuration changes go through approval gates (`FEATURES.md`). |
| 3.4.6 | Least functionality | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Agent and plugins run in sandboxes with only declared capabilities; on hosts that can't run the sandbox runtime, the plugin subsystem is disabled rather than degraded to unsandboxed (`PLUGINS.md`). |
| 3.4.7 | Restrict nonessential programs/ports/protocols/services | | L2 | L3 | Shared | ✅ Shipped | Default-deny egress per sandbox; worker admin endpoint is loopback-only, never exposed (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` topology note). Host firewalling is the deployment's. |
| 3.4.8 | Allow-by-exception (application allowlisting) | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Applied to the product's extension points: plugin sources are constrained by install policy and egress by each manifest allowlist. Marketplace integrity values are recorded in `openneko.plugins.json` but are not independently recomputed and compared by OpenNeko after `npm install` (`packages/plugin-install/src/run-install.ts`). OS-level application allowlisting is the deployment's. |
| 3.4.9 | Control and monitor user-installed software | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Install policy enforced at CLI, worker, and web (`FEATURES.md` "Install policy"); policy changes flag (not yank) pre-existing installs for manual review (`PLUGINS.md`); unverified installs print loud warnings and remain sandboxed. |

## Identification & Authentication (IA)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.5.1 | Identify users, processes, devices | L1 | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Mandatory SSO creates a unique `app_user` per person keyed by the IdP-stable `sub` (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` `upsertUserFromIdentity`), while runs record the acting human and agent backend. Device identity is a deployment responsibility. Solo mode is outside scope. |
| 3.5.2 | Authenticate identities before access | L1 | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | In the assessed company profile, mandatory SSO gates app access with a valid session (HMAC-signed cookie, constant-time verification, expiry enforced — `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts` `decodeSession`); the OIDC flow guards against CSRF/open redirect via signed state cookies (`writeStateCookie`, `encodeReturnPath`). |
| 3.5.3 | Multifactor authentication | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Delegated to the mandatory IdP via the OIDC auth plugin (e.g. Scalekit); the operator must configure and evidence MFA enforcement there. |
| 3.5.4 | Replay-resistant authentication | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | The mandatory IdP supplies the OIDC authorization-code flow. OpenNeko uses a random signed state cookie, deletes it from the browser on callback, and issues HMAC-bound expiring `httpOnly`/`secure`/`sameSite=lax` session cookies (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`). State consumption is not tracked server-side, so IdP configuration and protocol guarantees remain part of the control. |
| 3.5.5 | Prevent identifier reuse | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko generates high-entropy user IDs (`usr_` + 72-bit random, `apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`) and refuses to bind an email already attached to a different SSO `sub`. The IdP owns identifier retirement/reuse policy; OpenNeko has no explicit tombstone mechanism for retired identifiers. |
| 3.5.6 | Disable identifiers after inactivity | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | In the mandatory-SSO profile, the IdP must define and enforce identifier inactivity/disable policy. OpenNeko supports immediate application-level disable through `disabled_at`, and disabled users' existing sessions fail on the next user lookup (`db/migrations/0035_app_user_disabled.sql`; `getCurrentUser`). OpenNeko does not automatically mirror an IdP inactivity decision without a provisioning/synchronization integration. |
| 3.5.7 | Enforce password complexity and changed characters | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Interactive authentication is delegated to the mandatory IdP; configure and evidence its password-complexity policy. The setup wizard password is a database credential, not an application login. |
| 3.5.8 | Prohibit password reuse for defined generations | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Configure and evidence the mandatory IdP's password-history policy. |
| 3.5.9 | Restrict temporary passwords and require immediate change | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Configure and evidence the mandatory IdP's temporary-credential policy. |
| 3.5.10 | Cryptographically protected password/credential storage | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | All stored credentials (tokens, keys, passwords) are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM `enc:v1` (`packages/secret-crypt/src/index.ts`, `apps/openneko/internal/config/crypt.go`, `SECRETS.md`); credentials are never typed into chat and never enter model context (`FEATURES.md` "Credentials stay out of chat"). |
| 3.5.11 | Obscure authentication feedback | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Plugin secret prompts use hidden input at the CLI (`PLUGINS.md`); browser password fields mask input. |

## Media Protection (MP)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.8.3 | Sanitize media before disposal/reuse | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Physical media handling is the operator's. Product-side note: all state lives in one Postgres + one secrets file, so the surface to sanitize is small and known (`README.md` "single Postgres"). |
| 3.8.6 | Encrypt CUI on media during transport | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Backup transport is the operator's; encrypting backups at rest is theirs too (see 3.8.9). |
| 3.8.7 | Control removable media | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Host/endpoint control. |
| 3.8.9 | Protect confidentiality of backup CUI | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Secrets inside any backup are already ciphertext (`enc:v1`, `packages/secret-crypt`); business data in Postgres dumps is plaintext — the operator must encrypt backups. |

## Maintenance (MA) / Risk Assessment (RA)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.7.5 | MFA for nonlocal maintenance | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | SSH/remote administration of the host is outside the product. |
| 3.11.2 | Vulnerability scanning | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | The assessed organization must periodically and event-driven scan the deployed application, containers, hosts, dependencies, and surrounding boundary with its approved vulnerability-management tooling. OpenNeko's repository CI does not substitute for—or constrain—the client's authenticated deployment scanning. |
| 3.11.3 | Remediate vulnerabilities | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Release and smoke-gated deployment workflows provide a fast path to publish and deploy fixes (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `post-release-smoke.yml`, `deploy.yml`), but without 3.11.2 scanning and remediation tracking there is no systematic detection-to-closure process. |

## Remaining Level 2 requirements — complete disposition

The rows below are the requirements previously omitted from the product-focused
sections. Together with the detailed rows above, they complete the 110-requirement
Level 2 set. `Inherited` here means OpenNeko supplies no standalone mechanism;
the deploying organization must implement and evidence the requirement across
the assessed system boundary.

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.1.4 | Separate duties to reduce malicious activity without collusion | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko separates admin/member and human/agent roles, but it does not implement an organizational separation-of-duties matrix or require two distinct people for sensitive operations. |
| 3.1.22 | Control CUI on publicly accessible systems | L1 | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko is designed for controlled access and supplies no public-publishing workflow or CUI review gate. The organization must prohibit public exposure or provide review/removal procedures and perimeter controls. |
| 3.2.1 | Security awareness for managers, administrators, and users | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational training program; OpenNeko provides no LMS or training-attestation mechanism. |
| 3.2.2 | Train personnel for assigned security duties | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational role-based training and records. |
| 3.2.3 | Insider-threat awareness training | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational training and reporting program. |
| 3.3.3 | Review and update logged events | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko records fixed product event classes, but the organization must define, periodically review, and update which system-boundary events are logged. No product workflow manages that review. |
| 3.4.3 | Track, review, approve/disapprove, and log system changes | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Versioned compose/config artifacts and product audit records contribute evidence, but infrastructure changes and the organizational approval process are deployment responsibilities. |
| 3.4.4 | Analyze security impact before changes | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Requires an organizational pre-change security-impact analysis and evidence; smoke tests do not replace that analysis. |
| 3.6.1 | Establish operational incident-handling capability | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | OpenNeko exports audit data and behavior alerts, but incident preparation, detection/analysis, containment, recovery, and user response are organizational capabilities. |
| 3.6.2 | Track, document, and report incidents | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational incident case management and reporting to required authorities; OpenNeko has no incident-reporting workflow. |
| 3.6.3 | Test incident-response capability | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational exercises and retained test evidence. |
| 3.7.1 | Perform system maintenance | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Host, platform, database, network, and application maintenance program. |
| 3.7.2 | Control maintenance tools, techniques, mechanisms, and personnel | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Deployment maintenance authorization and tooling controls. |
| 3.7.3 | Sanitize equipment removed for off-site maintenance | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Physical equipment and media handling. |
| 3.7.4 | Check diagnostic/test media for malicious code | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Endpoint/media protection in the hosting environment. |
| 3.7.6 | Supervise maintenance personnel lacking required access | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational personnel and maintenance-session supervision. |
| 3.8.1 | Physically control and securely store media containing CUI | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Physical and backup-media protection. |
| 3.8.2 | Limit access to CUI on system media | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Storage, backup, host, and physical access controls. |
| 3.8.4 | Mark media with CUI markings and distribution limits | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational media-marking procedure; OpenNeko does not label exported artifacts as CUI. |
| 3.8.5 | Control and account for media during transport | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational custody and transport controls. |
| 3.8.8 | Prohibit portable storage without an identifiable owner | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Endpoint/removable-media policy and enforcement. |
| 3.9.1 | Screen individuals before granting CUI-system access | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Personnel screening and authorization process. |
| 3.9.2 | Protect systems during and after personnel actions | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Disabling an `app_user` invalidates application access on the next request, but transfer/termination triggers, IdP deprovisioning, asset return, and broader access removal are organizational responsibilities. |
| 3.10.1 | Limit physical access to systems and operating environments | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Facility, data-center, workstation, and hardware controls. |
| 3.10.2 | Protect and monitor facilities and support infrastructure | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Facility and hosting-provider controls. |
| 3.10.3 | Escort visitors and monitor visitor activity | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Physical security process. |
| 3.10.4 | Maintain physical-access audit logs | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Facility access-control system and records. |
| 3.10.5 | Control and manage physical-access devices | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Badge, key, lock, and credential management. |
| 3.10.6 | Safeguard CUI at alternate work sites | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Remote-work, endpoint, facility, and network policy. |
| 3.11.1 | Periodically assess organizational risk | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational risk assessment covering the complete system boundary. This code mapping is an input, not the assessment itself. |
| 3.12.1 | Periodically assess security controls | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Formal assessment using NIST SP 800-171A/CMMC objectives and retained evidence. |
| 3.12.2 | Maintain plans of action for deficiencies | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational operational plan-of-action and CMMC POA&M governance. |
| 3.12.3 | Continuously monitor security-control effectiveness | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Product behavior monitoring and audit export contribute signals; the organization must monitor the full boundary and control set. |
| 3.12.4 | Develop and update the system security plan | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | The organization must produce the authoritative SSP describing scope, environment, connections, and implementation. This file is supporting product evidence only. |
| 3.13.2 | Use secure architecture, engineering, and development principles | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Sandbox/control-plane separation and default-deny egress demonstrate product security architecture (`OPENSHELL.md`), while the organization must address the complete system architecture and SDLC. |
| 3.14.3 | Monitor security alerts/advisories and respond | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | OpenNeko provides product behavior alerts but has no vendor/dependency advisory ingestion and response workflow; the organization must monitor relevant sources and track action. |

## System & Communications Protection (SC)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.13.1 | Boundary protection | L1 | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Every untrusted component (agent, each plugin) sits behind its own default-deny sandbox boundary; the only trusted control plane is the worker/web process (`OPENSHELL.md` architecture). External perimeter (firewall/proxy) is the deployment's. |
| 3.13.3 | Separate user functionality from system management | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Control plane (DB, secrets, policy, approvals) is physically separated from the agent runtime: `runChatTurn` splits into host-side prologue/epilogue and sandboxed `runCore` (`OPENSHELL.md`, `packages/llm/src/work/`). |
| 3.13.4 | Prevent unauthorized info transfer via shared resources | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Per-plugin isolated microVMs; per-operator OAuth tokens are stored per-person and injected per invocation, never shared (`PLUGINS.md` "Per-person integrations", `FEATURES.md`). |
| 3.13.5 | Subnetworks for publicly accessible components | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | OpenNeko is not designed to be public-facing; exposure topology (DMZ, reverse proxy) is the operator's. |
| 3.13.6 | Deny-all, permit-by-exception network traffic | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Literally the sandbox egress model: default-deny, allowed per `(host, binary)` for the agent and per manifest for plugins (`OPENSHELL.md` "Egress is default-deny"). |
| 3.13.7 | Prevent split tunneling | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Endpoint/VPN configuration. |
| 3.13.8 | Encrypt CUI in transit | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Model/plugin egress is HTTPS; the OpenShell gateway uses mTLS internally (`OPENSHELL.md` Deployment). The web UI itself serves HTTP on localhost — remote access requires the operator's TLS reverse proxy. |
| 3.13.9 | Terminate network connections at the end of communications sessions | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Connection lifetime and termination are controlled by the client's TLS reverse proxy, load balancer, VPN, firewall, and container/network stack. OpenNeko's authentication-cookie lifetime is addressed separately under 3.1.11 and is not the network-connection requirement in 3.13.9. |
| 3.13.10 | Cryptographic key management | | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | A local 32-byte key is generated at `~/.config/openneko/secret-key` and newly created keys are set to mode 0600 (`packages/secret-crypt/src/index.ts`); enterprise deployments can use external Infisical-backed secrets (`SECRETS.md`). Existing key permissions are not validated or repaired, and local `enc:v1` data has no key identifier or built-in re-encryption workflow, so lifecycle, backup, rotation, and separation controls remain with the deployment. |
| 3.13.11 | FIPS-validated cryptography | | L2 | L3 | Product | ❌ Gap | Algorithms are FIPS-approved (AES-256-GCM, SHA-256, HMAC-SHA-256) but the crypto modules (Node `node:crypto`/OpenSSL as shipped, Go stdlib) are not FIPS-140-validated builds. Deployments requiring FIPS validation need FIPS-mode OpenSSL/BoringCrypto builds. |
| 3.13.12 | Control collaborative computing devices | | L2 | L3 | N/A | N/A | No camera/mic surface. |
| 3.13.13 | Control and monitor mobile code | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | The mobile-code problem *is* the product's core threat model: LLM-generated behavior and third-party plugin code always execute inside policy sandboxes — there is no unsandboxed mode (`OPENSHELL.md`); untrusted community skill shell blocks can be wrapped in one-shot microVMs (`PLUGINS.md` `allowSandboxedSkillEscape`). |
| 3.13.14 | Control VoIP | | L2 | L3 | N/A | N/A | No VoIP surface. |
| 3.13.15 | Protect authenticity of communication sessions | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | HMAC-SHA-256-signed session cookies with constant-time comparison (`apps/web/src/lib/auth.ts`); mTLS between gateway components (`OPENSHELL.md`); signed single-use OIDC state. |
| 3.13.16 | Protect CUI at rest | | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | OpenNeko application-encrypts credential material with AES-256-GCM (`packages/secret-crypt`, `SECRETS.md`, `db/migrations/0047_data_source_secret.sql`) but intentionally does not impose application-layer encryption on general PostgreSQL rows. The client must select, operate, and evidence encryption for PostgreSQL storage and backups—such as encrypted disks/volumes, managed-database encryption, or TDE—within its assessed deployment boundary. |

## System & Information Integrity (SI)

| Control | Technical requirement | L1 | L2 | L3 | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|---|---|---|
| 3.14.1 | Identify and correct system flaws | L1 | L2 | L3 | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Release and post-release smoke workflows provide a path to distribute and gate corrections (`.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `post-release-smoke.yml`, `deploy.yml`). The repository has no systematic dependency/container vulnerability scanning, so identification and remediation tracking require additional product and deployment processes. |
| 3.14.2 | Protect against malicious code at designated locations | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Host/container EDR or anti-malware is the operator's. Product sandboxing limits untrusted-code impact but does not replace malicious-code protection. |
| 3.14.4 | Update malicious-code protection when releases are available | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Deployment EDR/anti-malware update configuration and evidence. |
| 3.14.5 | Perform periodic and real-time malicious-code scans | L1 | L2 | L3 | Deployment | Inherited | Deployment scanning configuration and evidence. |
| 3.14.6 | Monitor systems and traffic for attacks | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Behavioral threshold monitoring on the agent: control-plane call rates per run, action requests/hour, memory writes/hour raise `behavior_alert` rows and dispatch `security.behavior_threshold` events for paging (`packages/llm/src/work/behavior-monitor.ts`, `db/migrations/0043_behavior_alerts.sql`). Network IDS is the deployment's. |
| 3.14.7 | Identify unauthorized use | | L2 | L3 | Product | ✅ Shipped | Dual-identity audit means no anonymous privileged action (`0042_dual_identity_audit.sql`); behavior alerts flag activity outside the envelope; security profiles (solo/team/org/hardened) scale alarm sensitivity (`FEATURES.md` "Security profiles"). |

## Level 3 only — all 24 selected NIST SP 800-172 requirements

| Control | Technical requirement | Applicability | Status | Rationale / evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AC 3.1.2e | Restrict CUI access to organization-controlled endpoints | Deployment | Inherited | Endpoint/NAC control. |
| AC 3.1.3e | Secure transfer between security domains | Shared | 🟡 Partial | The gateway egress proxy is a controlled cross-domain transfer point: the sandbox↔model boundary strips/injects credentials on the wire (`OPENSHELL.md`). Broader cross-domain solutions are the deployment's. |
| AT 3.2.1e | Provide advanced-threat awareness and update it for changing threats | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational threat-awareness program and training records. |
| AT 3.2.2e | Conduct role-tailored practical threat-training exercises | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational exercises, feedback, and retained participation evidence. |
| CM 3.4.1e | Maintain an authoritative repository of approved and integrity-verified components | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Versioned configuration and inventories contribute, and Linux release downloads are checksum-verified. Plugin integrity metadata is not independently verified after `npm install`, some images float, and the organization must maintain the boundary-wide authoritative repository. |
| CM 3.4.2e | Automated detection/response to misconfigured or unauthorized components | Product | 🟡 Partial | `openneko doctor`/`status` probe what's actually serving (`FEATURES.md` "Honest status"); policy changes automatically flag non-conforming installed plugins for removal (`PLUGINS.md`). No continuous drift detection for host config. |
| CM 3.4.3e | Automated asset inventory | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Plugin registry self-reconciles from `openneko.plugins.json` with hot reload (`PLUGINS.md`); container inventory is declared in compose. Full-environment asset discovery is the deployment's. |
| IA 3.5.1e | Bidirectional cryptographic authentication between components | Product | 🟡 Partial | mTLS between the OpenShell gateway and its clients; per-sandbox JWTs authenticate sandboxes to the gateway (`OPENSHELL.md` Deployment). Not yet universal across every internal hop (worker admin endpoint relies on loopback isolation). |
| IA 3.5.3e | Block untrusted assets from connecting | Deployment | Inherited | NAC is network infrastructure. |
| IR 3.6.1e | Maintain a 24/7 security operations center capability | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational or contracted SOC capability; OpenNeko audit exports and alerts are possible inputs. |
| IR 3.6.2e | Maintain a cyber incident response team deployable within 24 hours | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational staffing, procedures, communications, and exercise evidence. |
| PS 3.9.2e | Review adverse personnel information and take access action | Deployment | Inherited | Personnel-security and access-governance process; OpenNeko user disable can execute an application-level removal decision. |
| RA 3.11.1e | Perform threat-informed risk assessment | Deployment | Inherited | Organization-wide risk assessment informed by current threat intelligence. |
| RA 3.11.2e | Threat hunting with threat intelligence | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational capability; the exportable audit chain and behavior alerts are the product's food for it. |
| RA 3.11.3e | Use advanced automation and analytics to identify risk | Deployment | Inherited | Boundary-wide security analytics capability; OpenNeko's fixed behavior thresholds are not a complete advanced risk-identification solution. |
| RA 3.11.4e | Document the rationale for selected security solutions | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational risk analysis and SSP documentation. |
| RA 3.11.5e | Assess security-solution effectiveness at least annually and on relevant triggers | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational testing and assessment driven by threat information and incidents. |
| RA 3.11.6e | Assess, respond to, and monitor supply-chain risk | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational supplier and component risk-management program. Plugin source/integrity observations in this mapping are inputs only. |
| RA 3.11.7e | Develop and maintain a supply-chain risk-management plan | Deployment | Inherited | Organizational plan, roles, processes, and evidence. |
| CA 3.12.1e | Conduct independent penetration testing at least annually | Deployment | Inherited | Organizationally commissioned independent testing of the complete Level 3 scope. Repository tests and release smoke tests are not penetration tests. |
| SC 3.13.4e | Physical/logical isolation techniques | Product | ✅ Shipped | Per-component microVM isolation is the architecture: agent and every plugin in separate sandboxes, control plane outside, key material excluded from the box and verifiably absent (`OPENSHELL.md` "Verifying key isolation"). |
| SI 3.14.1e | Verify critical software integrity with a root of trust | Shared | 🟡 Partial | Linux release checksums contribute, but plugin artifacts are not independently verified after installation and there is no hardware-backed root of trust or signed-boot chain. Platform integrity remains a deployment responsibility. |
| SI 3.14.3e | Secure or isolate specialized assets | Deployment | Inherited | The organization must identify specialized assets and either assess them against all requirements or isolate them in purpose-specific networks with SSP-documented mitigations. |
| SI 3.14.6e | Use threat indicators to guide intrusion detection and hunting | Deployment | Inherited | SOC/IDS capability using open, commercial, and DoD-provided threat sources. OpenNeko can export audit data but does not ingest IOC feeds into an IDS. |

## Summary of open product responsibilities

This list is intentionally limited to rows whose applicability is `Product`
and whose status is not `✅ Shipped`. Shared and inherited requirements remain
visible in the complete matrix but are not mislabeled as OpenNeko product gaps.

1. **3.13.11 — Gap:** OpenNeko's shipped Node/OpenSSL and Go cryptographic modules are not FIPS 140-validated builds. This matters wherever those modules provide CUI confidentiality rather than a client-controlled FIPS boundary doing so.
2. **CM 3.4.2e — Partial:** product status and policy reconciliation exist, but continuous automated drift detection/remediation does not cover every OpenNeko component.
3. **IA 3.5.1e — Partial:** OpenShell gateway links use mTLS and per-sandbox JWTs, but bidirectional cryptographic authentication is not universal across every internal component hop.
