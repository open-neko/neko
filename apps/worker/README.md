# Worker

The worker owns background jobs, workflow execution, plugins, channel
delivery, and the durable workflow scheduler.

## Durable workflow scheduler

Cron is durable application state, not an in-process timer.
`workflow_schedule_state` stores the database-authoritative next occurrence
for every active cron workflow. `workflow_schedule_firing` is a transactional
firing ledger and outbox. A materialization transaction inserts the firing and
advances its cursor together; the unique `(workflow_id, scheduled_for)` key
makes concurrent or repeated sweeps idempotent.

An independent 30-second worker loop:

1. Synchronizes active definitions and materializes due firings.
2. Recovers expired dispatch/run leases.
3. Leases pending firings and delivers them to `workflow_run_fire` via
   pg-boss.

pg-boss is the delivery transport, not the schedule clock or source of truth.
The minute pg-boss queue remains only for behavior and watcher maintenance.

### Delivery and recovery

Delivery is at least once. Every cron queue payload carries a
`scheduleFiringId`; the consumer atomically claims that ledger row before it
creates a work thread or workflow run. Duplicate deliveries therefore do no
work.

| Failure point                                      | Recovery                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Before materialization commits                     | Cursor and firing both roll back.                                         |
| After materialization, before queue delivery       | The pending firing remains in the outbox.                                 |
| After queue send, before marking it enqueued       | The dispatch lease expires and the delivery is safely sent again.          |
| Duplicate queue delivery                           | Only the first ledger claim succeeds.                                     |
| Schedule disabled or edited before claim           | The unclaimed firing is cancelled; a queued duplicate cannot claim it.    |
| Worker interruption during an agent run            | The run lease returns to pending for retry.                               |
| Ledger completion update lost after a terminal run | Recovery observes the terminal run and completes the firing.              |

External action adapters still need their own idempotency keys: no scheduler
can make an arbitrary remote side effect exactly once. The firing ledger
guarantees one active OpenNeko consumer per occurrence and retains the
occurrence until it is consumed.

### Catch-up

New, edited, and re-enabled schedules start at the first occurrence strictly
after the definition update, so they never fabricate a pre-enable run.

The default `coalesce` policy emits only the latest missed occurrence after
downtime. `replay` emits a bounded prefix (24 by default) and leaves the cursor
overdue for later ticks until the backlog drains. Daily run budgets include
both existing workflow runs and materialized firings.

### Health and deployment

The loop persists progress in `workflow_scheduler_health` and exposes a
process-local progress signal:

- `GET /health` returns 503 while the scheduler is starting, failing, or has
  not succeeded for 120 seconds.
- `GET /health/scheduler` returns timestamps, the last error, consecutive
  failures, and materialized/dispatched/recovered counts.

The released-image VM deployment polls `/health/scheduler` inside the new
worker and fails unless that boot completes a successful scheduler database
transaction. This detects a live process whose schedule loop is not making
progress.

Diagnostic queries:

```sql
select * from workflow_schedule_state where workflow_id = $1;
select * from workflow_schedule_firing
where workflow_id = $1 order by scheduled_for desc limit 20;
select * from workflow_scheduler_health where id = 'cron';
```
