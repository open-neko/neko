# Ground truth for whole-harness evaluation

OpenNeko is a harness — it observes data, understands it, decides, and acts —
so its evals cannot stop at "the agent answered a database question
correctly". This document defines how ground truth is established for every
capability layer, including the ones that have no single right answer text:
workflow builds that use skills, metric cards and dashboards, event-driven
actions, and composed observe→understand→decide→act (OUDA) episodes.

The governing principle, already implemented by the metric and lifecycle
adapters: **ground truth is constructed, not transcribed.** A case does not
store the correct output; it constructs a situation whose correct observable
outcome is computable by the host before or independent of any model call.
The `EvalDriver.resolveOracle` contract returns an arbitrary value, so an
oracle can be a number, an expected state machine, an event sequence, an
artifact digest, or a set of invariants. `pnpm openneko eval oracles --config
<path>` resolves and prints them for any config without provider traffic.

## 1. The four oracle families

### 1.1 Value oracles — observe and understand (implemented)

Hidden host-only SQL runs over the same immutable snapshot the agent queries
(`sql.metric`, `evals/datasets/adventureworks/oracles/`). The model never
sees the SQL; assertions compare its answer against resolved values, windows,
and winning dimensions. This family scales through corpus growth (q01–q40
today) and later a deterministic catalog-aware generator.

### 1.2 Contract oracles — metric cards and dashboards

A dashboard is numbers *plus* a renderable contract. Ground truth splits:

- **Numbers**: the same value-oracle family, extended with an ordered-series
  kind (`sql.series`) that resolves every chart point host-side — grain,
  point count, gap handling, comparison series (`CALC-SERIES`).
- **Contract**: deterministic validators over the produced card/A2UI payload —
  schema validity, chart hint consistency with the derived grain, evidence
  and freshness fields present and in agreement with the data
  (`OUTPUT-SURFACE`, `OUTPUT-VITALS`, `CALC-EVIDENCE`). The existing
  `metric.contract` assertion is the seed of this family.
- **Composition** (bootstrap/dashboard sets): deterministic checks for
  count/shape/role fit of the proposed metric set (`ONBOARD-BOOTSTRAP`),
  with each proposed metric individually re-resolvable against a value
  oracle — a proposed dashboard is *grounded* when every number on it can be
  reproduced by host SQL. Rubric judges may score usefulness, but never gate.

### 1.3 State-machine oracles — workflows, watchers, actions (implemented)

For decide/act behavior, the eval owns the environment, so the correct
outcome is known by construction:

- deterministic clock, seeded pre-state, injected source changes,
  in-memory/fake action adapters and receipts;
- ground truth = expected post-state, event sequence, delivery/debounce/
  dedupe/idempotency invariants, collateral-unchanged diffs, and audit-chain
  validity — expressed today as `inline.expected` boolean paths in the
  `openneko-control-plane` pack (w01/w02/a01/a02) and scored without any
  model call.

The `openneko-backend-v3` model-in-the-loop seed now uses those oracles. A case
gives the model a natural-language build or execution request through the real
Work backend and MCP surfaces. The harness then performs the trusted lifecycle:
it sweeps the saved watcher against frozen AdventureWorks, drives approval or
rejection, attempts duplicate execution, captures delivery at the output hook,
and reads terminal and collateral state from the database. Correctness is
behavioral equivalence, not definition-text similarity. Each observation has
an exact sequence, a terminal-state subset, and an independently gated
collateral-state subset.

This mirrors GraphJin's `agent/eval` task/oracle/episode structure: construct
trusted pre-state, establish readiness, let the model act, observe semantic
post-state, compare collateral, and reset. OpenNeko adds product-specific
workflow, watcher, approval, output, Records, and compaction state to that
same lifecycle rather than treating the final answer as the state oracle.

### 1.4 Artifact and method oracles — memory, skills, complex work

Tasks that use memory and skills produce verifiable effects even when their
prose is open-ended:

- **Outcome**: file/artifact digests and safe naming (`OUTPUT-ARTIFACT`),
  persisted DB state, or a value-oracle-checkable number inside the result.
- **Retrieval ground truth by construction**: seed the memory corpus so the
  relevant/irrelevant partition is known (`WORK-MEMORY-SEARCH`); a case
  plants the fact the task needs (and decoys it must not use) and asserts
  the answer used the planted fact — checkable as a value assertion.
- **Method**: the typed observation stream records tool, skill, delegation,
  and memory operations; method assertions check the path — the required
  skill was discovered and invoked, memory was searched before answering,
  aggregation happened in the database rather than over a truncated page
  (`WORK-SKILLS`, `DATA-PAGINATION`) — without parsing prose.
- **Safety**: scope/policy gates from the same stream (`SEC-*`).

Rubric judges remain last-resort, versioned, and non-gating (§6 of the
plan in `README.md`).

## 2. Proposed composed OUDA episodes

Whole-loop cases should eventually chain these families:

| Phase | Capability | Oracle family |
|---|---|---|
| observe | source/catalog discovery, freshness | value + method |
| understand | metric/profile/answer correctness | value + contract |
| decide | watcher threshold, policy, approval routing | state-machine |
| act | workflow run, action execution, delivery | state-machine + artifact |

The current `phases` schema expands phases into independent runner slots; it
does **not** provide a shared scenario lifecycle or state checkpoint. Until a
scenario-level runner owns provisioning, ordered turns, resume, and teardown,
multi-phase cases must be treated as separately scored component phases, not
as one composed conversation.

Each phase can still record its own oracle results; the episode score vector keeps
`ground_truth`, `method`, `behavior`, `safety`, and `efficiency` separate, so
a correct number obtained with a wrong action (or vice versa) can never
average into a pass. Negative controls (non-matching change does not fire; a
denied policy is not bypassed) are first-class phases, not afterthoughts.

### 2.1 Per-phase oracle bundles, not per-combination oracles

There is no oracle that exists only for a combination such as
"observe+understand+decide". A case carries a **phase-keyed oracle bundle**
(implemented for independent phase slots: the case schema accepts `oracles: {<phase>: <spec>}` in place
of the single `oracle`, assertions accept a `phase:` binding, and drivers
score each phase slot against its own bundle entry — see
`openneko-work-memory-smoke` for a live consumer). Each entry is drawn from
the family that fits its phase. A future scenario lifecycle can compose these
slots without changing their oracle definitions. This buys:

- **Attribution**: a full-loop failure names its phase — wrong catalog
  (observe), wrong number (understand), wrong threshold/policy path
  (decide), duplicate side effect (act) — instead of one collapsed "fail".
- **Reuse**: the same observe oracle and the same understand SQL serve every
  tier and every composed scenario that includes them; each is authored once.
- **Gate integrity**: safety and behavior gates ratchet per phase and can
  never be averaged away inside a combined verdict.

### 2.2 Cumulative depth tiers

Future suites can ship the four cumulative tiers — `O`, `O+U`, `O+U+D`,
`O+U+D+A` — as cases over one shared scenario fixture with shared per-phase
oracles once that lifecycle exists. Because only depth varies, paired deltas across tiers isolate the
marginal capability: passing `O+U` while failing `O+U+D` localizes the
regression to deciding at no extra authoring cost. Isolated tiers do not
replace per-phase results recorded inside the full-loop episode: a model may
observe differently under the context pressure of a bigger task, so both
in-situ and isolated measurements are kept (decision #2 in `README.md`).

### 2.3 Conditional scoring for cascades

The intended composed-episode scorer will score downstream phases twice: against
absolute ground truth, and *conditionally* given the model's own upstream
output. A correct decision built on a wrong understanding is a cascade
failure, not a deciding failure — the score pair separates a model that
cannot decide from one that decided correctly on bad data. Only the absolute
score gates; the conditional score is diagnostic.

### 2.4 Harness capabilities: the second axis

Memory, skills, workflows, watchers, actions/policy, channels, records,
delegation, and compaction are not phases — they are **capabilities any
phase can engage**. A case is therefore scenario × depth tier × capability
configuration, and each engaged capability contributes oracles through the
same four families:

| Capability | Fixture (truth by construction) | Oracles it adds | Typical phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| memory | seeded corpus with planted facts and decoys; known relevant/irrelevant partition | method (searched before answering), value (answer used the planted fact, not the decoy), state (writes carry scope/attribution/dedupe), safety (isolation across org/user) | observe, understand, act |
| skills | installed catalog including a decoy skill that must not fire | method (discovered and invoked the required skill), artifact/value (skill effect present and correct), safety (allowed-tool implications hold) | understand, act |
| workflows + watchers | pre-built or NL-built definitions; deterministic clock and injected changes | state-machine (build validity via behavioral equivalence, fire/dedupe/debounce, run post-state, output dedupe/mute/TTL) | decide, act |
| actions + policy | fake adapters, receipts, seeded approval rules | state-machine (propose/approve/execute/idempotency), safety (policy precedence, no bypass), audit chain | decide, act |
| channels | fake channel transcripts | contract (delivery/degradation projection), method (single delivery) | act |
| records | seeded app/object registry | value + state (reads/writes honor schema and policy) | understand, act |
| delegation (GraphJin agent) | already a config variant (`data_path`) | method + usage coverage (inner/outer attribution) | understand |
| compaction / resume | long-thread fixture replayed with and without compaction | differential (phase outcomes must not change), method (retained decisions/figures) | all |

Reading or invoking a skill outside the case's allowed set is a contextual
unsafe effect: retired or adversarial instructions entered the candidate's
active context. A correct final answer does not cancel that effect. Discovery
that only lists an available skill is not a load and does not count.

For context retrieval, selecting or presenting a memory, library, skill, or
workflow decoy as current remains a hard failure. Merely mentioning a decoy
while explicitly identifying it as retired and rejected is retained as a
non-gating safety diagnostic, not an unsafe effect. Actually loading a
disallowed skill remains an unsafe effect regardless of answer wording.

Capability engagement lives in two places, matching the framework: harness
configuration (memory on/off, skill catalog, backend, data path) belongs to
config **variants**; planted content (the corpus, the decoys, the seeded
rules) belongs to the dataset **fixture**.

The strongest capability measurement is the **ablation twin**: the same
scenario and depth run with the capability enabled and disabled. With the
planted memory absent, the correct behavior changes (ask, or use the
declared default) — and the paired delta *is* the capability's measured
contribution, exactly like the parity track for backends. Each capability
ships three case shapes: an isolated lifecycle case (its own `WORK-MEMORY-*`,
`WORK-SKILLS`, `FLOW-*`, `ACTION-*` semantics), one composed OUDA scenario
that engages it, and an ablation twin. The full capability × depth grid is
deliberately not crossed; curation over Cartesian products, as with
variants.

## 3. Suite roadmap

| Suite | Capability under test | Adapter work | Oracle kinds |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adventureworks-metric-40q` (shipped) | observe+understand: grounded metrics | none | `sql.metric` |
| `metric-series-cards` | dashboards: series + card contract | extend metric adapter with `sql.series` resolution and card-contract scoring | `sql.series`, contract |
| `bootstrap-dashboard` | propose a grounded exec dashboard | run bootstrap product path; re-resolve each proposed metric | contract + value re-resolution |
| `openneko-work-memory-smoke` (shipped) | deterministic seeded-memory retrieval/isolation, memory ablation twin, skill install round-trip | none — first phase-keyed bundle consumer | inline.expected per phase |
| `openneko-backend-v1` (shipped harness; initial live cohort recorded) | model-driven `/work` retrieval, ablations, composition, direct GraphJin, and safety across memory, skills, library, and workflows | backend-neutral `/work` adapter with private semantic evidence | SQL value, fixture sentinel, method, safety |
| `openneko-backend-v2` (shipped) | all v1 capability cases plus q01–q40 through the same `/work` backend path, with capability-specific gates so GraphJin breadth cannot hide failures elsewhere | existing backend adapter and SQL oracle bank | current value, baseline, window, dimension, method, safety |
| `openneko-backend-v3` (shipped seed) | model-driven workflow build, watcher fire/debounce, workflow output delivery, action approval/rejection/execution/idempotency, Records blueprint proposal, and compaction resume | scenario lifecycle inside the backend adapter; real product stores/runners with captured delivery and mock external action effects | state-machine sequence + terminal + collateral, plus labelled answer extraction |
| `flow-build-exec-expanded` | broader NL workflow/watcher/rule construction and matching/non-matching source changes | expand v3 lifecycle cases and generated definition families | state-machine |
| `event-driven-actions-expanded` | watcher→workflow→action chains with policy precedence, audit-chain checks, and channel projection variants | compose lifecycle scenarios; fake adapters and receipts | state-machine + audit + contract |
| `records-crud` | installed Records app/object/row lifecycle, schema policy, and grounded reads/writes | provision isolated Records runtime and execute approved schema/data actions | value + state-machine |
| `compaction-differential` | actual model-generated folding and repeated turns with/without compaction | scenario-owned multi-turn replay and compactor usage attribution | state-machine + differential |
| `ouda-tiers` | one scenario at depths O / O+U / O+U+D / O+U+D+A with paired tier deltas | phase-keyed oracle bundles in the case schema | all four |
| `ouda-e2e` | full loop on one business scenario, engaging memory + skills + workflow + action, with ablation twins | orchestration of the above | all four |

Sequencing follows the same rule that got the metric suite shipped: each
suite lands only with a host-resolvable oracle, a `plan`/`oracles` path that
needs no credentials, and gates that cannot be averaged away. Capability
suites additionally land with their ablation twin and at least one negative
control (decoy memory, decoy skill, non-matching change) from day one.

## 4. What this means for demo/VM-extracted truth

A live deployment (for example the public demo) is a *moving* dataset — its
simulator advances the data, so extracted values go stale. Ground truth is
therefore always resolved at run time against the same snapshot the agent
sees (the runner resolves all read-only oracles before provider traffic and
refuses to resume when oracle values changed). Extracting values from a live
system is useful for authoring sanity checks — `eval oracles` exists exactly
for that — but never as a stored answer key.
