# OpenNeko semantic coverage registry

> **INITIAL INVENTORY — 2026-08-10.** Audited against `FEATURES.md`, worker
> jobs, `packages/llm/src/work`, `packages/llm/src/workflows`, records,
> channels, plugin contracts, and the current database state machines on
> `origin/main` at `ef396e0`. This becomes machine-readable
> as `evals/semantics.yaml`.

This registry defines what “evaluate the OpenNeko harness” means. A model can
answer hundreds of database questions correctly while OpenNeko is still broken
at identity, memory, workflow delivery, approval, mutation, channel rendering,
or recovery. Those behaviors need stable names and explicit coverage.

## Coverage contract

Each machine-readable semantic will contain:

- stable `id`, description, lifecycle status, and owner paths;
- required eval layer: unit/contract, deterministic E2E, live-model E2E,
  stateful, adversarial, load, or platform smoke;
- dataset/source capabilities and actor/security profile;
- case IDs and oracle kinds that prove the outcome;
- required telemetry observations and product summary fields;
- gate severity: hard safety, hard contract, quality ratchet, or advisory;
- exclusions with a named alternative verification suite.

The registry is checked against code-owned inventories. Adding a worker job,
agent/control-plane tool, `AgentEvent`, fence, workflow/action status, records
operation, plugin capability, or public feature requires either a semantic ID
or an explicit mapping to an existing one.

Tool use is evidence, not usually the outcome. Cases assert the resulting data,
state transition, delivery, denial, audit record, or user-visible contract.

`status`, `usage`, `telemetry`, `error`, `capability_denied`, `done`, `output_emit`,
`action_request_emit`, `action_request_result`, `needs_input`, `followups`, and
`vitals`.

## 9. Operability and recovery semantics

| ID | Semantic outcome | Primary verification |
|---|---|---|
| `OPS-JOB-LIFECYCLE` | Queue, running, retrying, succeeded, failed, and cancelled states are monotonic and attributable | job state oracle |
| `OPS-RECONCILE` | Lost worker/process state is reconciled without duplicate effects or permanently stuck runs | crash/restart E2E |

Packaging, installer, release promotion, and deployment smoke remain platform
verification rather than live-model quality evals, but they retain semantic IDs
so whole-product coverage cannot silently omit them.

## 10. Required state-machine coverage

The machine registry will enumerate legal and illegal transitions for at least:

- work run and processing job;
- workflow run and workflow output;
- action request and action execution;
- watcher and watch-event delivery;
- source subscription and source-change receipt;
- channel identity link;
- plugin install/runtime state;
- records schema saga, import run, connector cursor/cutover, and recycle state;
- configuration change/promote/adopt/restore;
- eval run, attempt, episode, shard, and baseline promotion.

Every transition suite includes idempotent replay, duplicate delivery, crash
between write and acknowledgement, authorization failure, and audit/provenance
assertions where applicable.

The exact `AgentEvent`, worker queue, and observation-kind inventories are
mapped to semantic owners in `evals/semantic-inventory.yaml`. Repository CI
extracts those unions/constants from source and fails on any unmapped or stale
item, so a new event, job, or telemetry operation cannot silently escape this
registry.

## 11. Worker-job ownership check

All current worker jobs map to the registry:

| Worker jobs | Semantic owners |
|---|---|
| `work-run` | `RUNTIME-*`, `WORK-*`, `OUTPUT-*` |
| `business-profile-build`, `industry-insights-build`, `bootstrap-metrics-build`, `metric-refresh` | `ONBOARD-*`, `METRIC-REFRESH` |
| `workflow-run-fire`, `workflow-cron-sweep`, `workflow-output-ttl-sweep` | `FLOW-RUN`, `FLOW-CRON`, `FLOW-OUTPUT-TTL` |
| `action-execute` | `ACTION-EXECUTE`, `ACTION-IDEMPOTENCY`, `ACTION-AUDIT` |
| `records-watch-evaluate` | `RECORDS-WATCH`, `WATCH-*` |
| `records-import` | `RECORDS-IMPORT` |
| `records-salesforce-export`, `records-salesforce-sync`, `records-salesforce-sync-sweep`, `records-salesforce-cutover` | `RECORDS-CONNECT` |
| `records-identity-link` | `RECORDS-IDENTITY` |
| `library-distill` | `LIBRARY-DISTILL`, `LIBRARY-LAYERS` |
| `records-backup-verify`, `records-ops-health`, `records-ops-watch`, `records-ops-finding`, `records-lifecycle-finding`, `records-system-finding` | `RECORDS-OPS`, `OPS-BACKUP` |

## 12. Corpus growth rule

The first AdventureWorks pack starts with the 20 known questions, then grows in
two ways:

1. deterministic catalog-derived generation supplies broad read/calculation
   coverage with category and difficulty quotas;
2. every production failure, field report, security finding, watcher bug, or
   mutation bug becomes a minimal curated regression case under its semantic
   IDs.

Generated volume cannot substitute for semantic breadth. Suite validation
enforces minimum and maximum quotas per family so hundreds of simple aggregates
cannot dominate the headline or starve joins, rankings, time windows, negative
controls, watchers, mutations, identity, and safety cases.
