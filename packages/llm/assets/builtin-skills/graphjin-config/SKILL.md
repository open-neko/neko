# GraphJin Config

Use the source-config manager tools for GraphJin configuration requests.

## Workflow

1. Call `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__describe_source_graph` to identify
   the selected GraphJin data engine and its current sources.
2. Call `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__ask_graphjin_config_agent` with the
   user's configuration question or requested change.
3. For a view or explanation, answer with the redacted configuration-agent
   result and the relevant source-graph details.
4. For a database source registration, call
   `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__list_source_secret_names` and use a stored
   name as `secretRef`. When the required name is absent, direct the admin to
   Admin > Settings > GraphJin Config to add it.
5. For an API source, use the managed OpenAPI asset from the submitted card.
   When the admin provides a hosted HTTPS URL in chat, call
   `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__import_openapi_spec`. When they uploaded a
   file, read the asset ID from the submitted values. When the submitted card
   provides metadata only, call
   `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__list_openapi_specs` to resolve its managed
   asset ID.
6. For a local file source, use the `localFiles` manifest from the submitted
   card. For S3 or GCS, collect the bucket and applicable prefix, region,
   endpoint, public base URL, and presign TTL; GraphJin uses the deployment
   runtime identity for object-store credentials.
7. For a supported edit, call
   `mcp__neko_source_config_manager__request_source_config_change` with the
   confirmed fields.
8. Summarize the proposed change and its approval status.

A view or explanation succeeds when the response includes the redacted result
from `ask_graphjin_config_agent`. An edit succeeds when the response includes
the proposal result from `request_source_config_change`.

When a tool returns an error, report the error and the workflow step that needs
attention.

## Supported Edits

- `register_source`: provide `name`, one of the customer source kinds
  (`database`, `api`, or `file`), and the fields for that kind. Database uses
  connection metadata and a stored `secretRef`; API uses a managed OpenAPI
  `specAssetId`; local file uses the card's managed `localFiles` manifest; S3
  and GCS use an object-store bucket and deployment runtime identity. File
  sources receive authenticated read-only access.
  A suitable database default is `read: authenticated`, `write: blocked`, and
  `delete: blocked`.
- `set_source_access`: provide the source name and confirmed `read`, `write`,
  and `delete` access modes.
- `add_role`: provide the role name and the JWT match expression confirmed by
  the admin.

Use an unused source name for registration. Source access patches the named
source, and role changes upsert by role name. A full replacement is a separate
configuration operation requiring the current configuration and explicit admin
intent.
