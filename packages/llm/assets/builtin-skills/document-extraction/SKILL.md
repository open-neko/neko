# Document Text Extraction

One command that turns any supported document into plain UTF-8 text on
stdout, degrading gracefully by trying the best available tool first:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_text.py FILE [--max-chars=N]
```

## What it handles

| Format | Preferred | Fallbacks |
|---|---|---|
| `.pdf` | pypdf | `pdftotext -layout`; then `pdftoppm` + `tesseract` OCR for scanned pages |
| `.docx` | python-docx | stdlib zipfile + XML strip (no deps needed) |
| `.pptx` | python-pptx | stdlib zipfile per-slide XML strip |
| `.xlsx` | openpyxl (values, tab-separated) | stdlib sharedStrings extraction |
| `.md .txt .csv .tsv .json .log` | direct read, utf-8 → utf-8-sig → latin-1 | — |
| `.html .htm .xml` | direct read + tag strip | — |
| anything else | printable-run fallback (like `strings`) | — |

Exit 0 with text on stdout on success; non-zero with a reason on stderr
when a format genuinely can't be handled (e.g. PDF with no extraction
tool installed).

## High-fidelity profile (Docling, opt-in)

For large or complex documents (multi-hundred-page PDFs, contracts with
tables), an optional [Docling](https://github.com/docling-project/docling)
extractor produces **structured Markdown** — headings, tables, and reading
order preserved — instead of a flat text dump. That structure lets the
library distiller chunk on natural boundaries rather than raw character
offsets.

It is **off by default** to keep the standard images slim (Docling pulls in a
sizeable ML stack). To enable it on the worker:

```bash
pip install docling            # into the worker image / host
export NEKO_DOCLING_EXTRACTION=true
```

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_docling.py FILE [--max-chars=N]   # Markdown to stdout
```

When the flag is set, supported formats (`.pdf .docx .pptx .xlsx .html`) route
through Docling; on any failure — including `docling` not being installed —
extraction **falls back** to `extract_text.py`, so enabling the flag before
installing the dependency never blocks an upload.

## Usage notes

- **Encoding**: never assume ASCII. The script already tries utf-8 then
  latin-1; for exotic encodings, check first with `file --mime FILE`
  and convert with `iconv -f <charset> -t UTF-8` before extraction.
- **Scanned PDFs**: if normal extraction returns almost nothing, the
  document is likely image-only; the script OCRs the first 10 pages
  automatically when `tesseract` is installed. For longer scans, run
  `pdftoppm -png -r 200 FILE page && tesseract page-N.png -` per page.
- **Spreadsheets**: output is tab-separated values per sheet with a
  `# SheetName` header — suitable for skimming, not for computation.
  Use the `xlsx` skill when you need real spreadsheet operations.
- **Big files**: output is capped (default 400k chars). Raise with
  `--max-chars=` only when you truly need the tail.
- Prefer this script over ad-hoc extraction one-liners so encoding and
  fallback handling stay consistent.
