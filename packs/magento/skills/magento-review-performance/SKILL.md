# Review Magento performance

Build an evidence-backed store briefing from the installed Magento metrics.
Treat `magento_analytics` as read-only and preserve the pack's checked-in
metric definitions instead of silently inventing alternative formulas.

## Establish the reporting frame

Before interpreting values, resolve and state:

- the Magento store scope or selected store IDs;
- the configured base currency;
- the Magento timezone; and
- a half-open reporting interval `[from, to)`.

Use the user's requested comparison period. If none is requested, report the
current period without manufacturing a trend. For a comparison, use an
equal-length immediately preceding period with the same store scope. Read
[scope and time](references/scope-and-time.md) when resolving store, currency,
or local-day boundaries.

## Gather evidence

Prefer the installed saved queries and their metric snapshots:

- commercial result: `net_invoiced_revenue`, `orders_placed`, and
  `average_order_value`;
- leakage: `refund_rate` and `cancellation_rate`;
- mix: `sales_by_store` and `top_products`;
- operating context for a full briefing: `fulfillment_backlog`,
  `fulfillment_age`, `stock_status`, `cron_health`, `indexer_health`, and
  `data_freshness`.

Read [metric definitions](references/metric-definitions.md) before calculating
or explaining a shipped metric. When a snapshot is stale, refresh or query the
same saved-query definition and disclose the observation time. Do not replace a
missing or null metric with zero.

## Interpret without overclaiming

- Separate order placement, invoicing, credit memos, cancellation, and
  shipment. They measure different lifecycle events.
- Treat a change as a fact only when both periods use identical scope and
  definitions. Show absolute values alongside percentages when the sample is
  small.
- Describe a store or SKU as associated with a result, not as its cause, unless
  direct evidence establishes causality.
- Do not report conversion rate without a connected traffic/session source.
- Do not report gross margin without a validated and sufficiently complete cost
  source.
- Do not query or expose customer, address, payment, credential, OAuth, admin,
  or password data.

## Deliver the briefing

Lead with the reporting frame and a compact scorecard. Then identify the few
material drivers, name the single highest-priority issue supported by the
evidence, and recommend the next diagnostic task. Route detailed follow-up to
the related Magento skill rather than expanding this reporting skill into an
incident investigation.
